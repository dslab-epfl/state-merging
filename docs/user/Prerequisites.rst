Cloud9 works on 64-bit Linux distributions.  It has been extensively tested on Ubuntu 10.10, and it should work with other distros as well.

In order to properly build and run Cloud9, you need to install the following packages: ``dejagnu``, ``flex``, ``bison``, ``protobuf-compiler``, ``libprotobuf-dev``, ``libboost-thread-dev``, ``libboost-system-dev``.
